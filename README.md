ðŸŽ§ Spotify Clone
A simple Spotify-style music player made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I built it to understand how audio works in JS and to practice DOM handling.

Features:
â€¢ Play / Pause songs
â€¢ Basic UI with album cover
â€¢ Responsive layout
â€¢ Simple, clean design

What I Learned:
â€¢ Audio element controls in JS
â€¢ DOM selection and event listeners
â€¢ Handling UI updates on user clicks

Next Steps:
â€¢ Add next/previous buttons
â€¢ Progress bar & playlist feature
