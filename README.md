A basic calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JS to brush up on logic and UI design.
It can handle basic math and includes clear & delete buttons.

Features:
• Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
• Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL)
• Works with multi-digit inputs
• Minimal & responsive design

What I Learned:
• DOM manipulation (querySelector, addEventListener)
• Using .value and slice(0, -1) for display updates
• Handling button events and expressions
